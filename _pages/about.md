Joan Martí-Carreras (or Joan Martí Carreras) is a PhD candidate at [Zoonotic Infectious Diseases Unit](https://rega.kuleuven.be/cev/zoonotic-infectious-diseases-unit), at the [Rega Instituut](https://rega.kuleuven.be/), [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven/); under the supervision of [Prof. Piet Maes](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Piet_Maes) and [Prof. Marc van Ranst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Van_Ranst). He holds a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Action (MSCA) Initial Training Network (ITN) scholarship, as Early-stage researcher 15 at [HONOURs](https://honours.eu/) for enhancing full-length genomic NGS assembly of viral pathogens with large genomes (> 100 kbp).

Biography
======

Born and raised in the [Empordà](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empord%C3%A0) region, from [Catalunya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia), [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain), he always had an appeal for the Natural Sciences, especially chemistry and biology. He did his undergraduate studies at [Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona](https://www.uab.cat/en/) in Genetics, preciously starting research with [Prof. Maria Pilar Garcia Guerreiro](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pilar_Garcia_Guerreiro) working in transposable element regulation through piRNAs in Drosophila. Additionally, He also worked as free-lance researcher for [PhD Victor Sarto i Monteys](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Victor_Sarto_i_Monteys) tackling the phylogeographic distribution of the [red palm weever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhynchophorus_ferrugineus) world-wide. Later on, he coursed a master in Bioinformatics for health sciences at [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/en/) and [Universitat de Barcelona](https://www.ub.edu/web/ub/en/), studying the global biogeographic distribution of _merA_ and _merB_ genes in the deep ocean (> 4000 m depth) by analyzing NGS data from Malaspina and Tara expeditions. The master thesis was conducted by [PhD Pablo Sanchez](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pablo_Sanchez19) and [Prof. Silvia G. Acinas](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Silvia_Acinas) from the [Institut de Ciències del Mar - ICM CSIC](http://www.icm.csic.es/?q=en).

Now he is conducting his PhD at the at [Zoonotic Infectious Diseases Unit](https://rega.kuleuven.be/cev/zoonotic-infectious-diseases-unit), at the [Rega Instituut](https://rega.kuleuven.be/), [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven/); under the supervision of [Prof. Piet Maes](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Piet_Maes). His PhD topic is on the recovery of complete genomes from large genome viruses and the study of their diversity. His case of study is the family Herpesviridae, specifically the human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and other betaherpesviruses.
